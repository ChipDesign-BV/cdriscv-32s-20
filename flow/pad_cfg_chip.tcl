# Chip pad configuration: the default LibreLane pad_cfg.tcl, plus the
# one thing it only does on request -- placing the top-level I/O
# terminals (BTerms) onto the pads' bond-pad pins.
#
# Without PAD_PLACE_IO_TERMINALS the pads place but every chip port is
# left unplaced, and global placement stops with GPL-0326 ("toplevel
# port is not placed") -- found on the first full-chip run, 2026-09-03.
# The PDK's sg13g2_io config.tcl carries the variable as a commented-out
# hint; the pad-side pin on every sg13g2_IOPad* master is `pad`.
#
# Only the signal-pad masters appear here: the chip RTL declares no
# power ports (power arrives at PNR), so the supply pads have no BTerms
# to place.
