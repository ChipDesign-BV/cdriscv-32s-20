## 1. What this is, and what it is not

This is a Failure Modes, Effects and Diagnostic Analysis of the
subsystem at the architecture level, built from three kinds of number,
each labeled throughout:

* **MEASURED** — element populations counted from the placed netlist
  (5 658 flip-flops attributed per block by register name, 319 488
  logical SRAM bits, 39 191 cells), and diagnostic coverage from the
  fault-injection campaigns of findings V9/V29/V30/V33/V37 (~10⁴
  classified single-event upsets, zero silent data corruption, zero
  latent configuration faults after V37).
* **ASSUMED** — base failure rates. **No foundry reliability data for
  IHP SG13G2 was available to this analysis.** The rates are typical
  published figures for a 130 nm-class process at sea level:
  700 FIT/Mbit SRAM soft errors, 400 FIT/Mbit flip-flop soft errors,
  20 FIT total permanent for a ~2.6 mm² die, 2 % multi-bit-upset
  fraction. **A real safety case replaces every one of these** with
  foundry data and a mission profile; the script makes that a
  five-line edit.
* **DERIVED** — the metrics.

This document is an architectural statement, not a certification. The
metrics landing above the ASIL D thresholds means the *architecture*
carries no structural gap under the stated assumptions — it does not
mean ASIL D compliance, which additionally requires qualified tools,
process evidence, foundry data and an assessed safety case.

```

**SPFM 99.6 %, LFM 91.4 %, residual 0.87 FIT** under the stated
assumptions — numerically above the ASIL D targets (SPFM ≥ 99 %,
LFM ≥ 90 %), with the caveats of section 1.

## 3. What the configuration parity is worth, in metric terms

Recomputing with the V37 configuration parity removed — single-bit
diagnostic coverage of every configuration register set to the zero
that V29 measured — gives **LFM 83.4 %**: below the ASIL D bar,
ASIL C territory. The one mechanism added in V37 is the difference
between the architecture clearing the latent-fault target and missing
it, which is the quantified form of what the campaign said in counts:
1 207 latent upsets out of 2 600 before, zero after.

## 4. Where the residual lives

Half the 0.87 FIT residual is the TCM arrays' triple-bit-and-beyond
tail past SEC-DED — reducible with layout interleaving (credit for
which is deliberately not taken here). Most of the rest is the
lockstep delay-and-compare structure and the reaction wiring of the
safety controller: the checkers themselves, which is where any DCLS
architecture's residual lives. The self-test hooks (SELFTEST, INJECT)
exist precisely to exercise these at start-up; crediting them would
raise DC on those rows and is left to the safety case.

## 5. Sensitivity

The metrics are ratios, so they are insensitive to the absolute FIT
scale (doubling every rate changes neither SPFM nor LFM). They are
sensitive to: the MBU fraction (2 % assumed; interleaving data would
justify less), the DCLS coverage figure (0.99 assumed, supported by
zero SDC in ~10⁴ injections but not proven to three nines), and the
BIST-dormancy treatment (counted mostly latent between runs; periodic
in-mission BIST would move it).

## 6. Handoff checklist for the safety-case owner

1. Replace the ASSUMED block in `scripts/fmeda.py` with foundry FIT
   data and the mission profile.
2. Decide the multi-bit story: SRAM column interleaving factor, and
   whether the software scrub (V30) is claimed for double-bit
   configuration coverage.
3. Common-cause analysis for the lockstep pair (shared clock, reset,
   voltage) — outside what fault injection can measure.
4. Credit or discard the start-up self-tests in the permanent-fault DC.
5. Re-run the script; the tables regenerate.
