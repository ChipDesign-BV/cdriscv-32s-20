# cdriscv-32s FMEDA computation (verification plan O9).
#
# Everything in this file is one of exactly three kinds of number, and
# each row of the tables says which:
#
#   MEASURED  -- element populations counted from the placed netlist
#                (build/gate/cdriscv_32s_20_subsys_pd_final.v), and diagnostic
#                coverage from the fault-injection campaigns
#                (verification_findings.md V9/V29/V30/V33/V37).
#   ASSUMED   -- base failure rates.  No foundry FIT data exists for
#                this design; the values are typical published figures
#                for a 130 nm-class process at sea level and are the
#                part a real safety case MUST replace.
#   DERIVED   -- everything computed from the above.
#
# Metrics follow the ISO 26262 definitions:
#   SPFM = 1 - sum(lambda_SPF) / sum(lambda_safety_related)
#   LFM  = 1 - sum(lambda_MPF_latent) / sum(lambda_SR - lambda_SPF)
# A fault is "safe" when it cannot violate the assumed safety goal
# (the campaigns' silent-ok class: correct result, configuration
# intact); a residual/single-point fault is dangerous and undetected;
# a latent multiple-point fault is a disabled mechanism nothing
# reported -- the class V29 measured at 46.4 % and V37 took to zero.
