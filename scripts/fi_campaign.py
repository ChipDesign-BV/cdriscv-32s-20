# Fault injection campaign driver.
#
# Runs single event upsets across the fault list in verif/fi/tb_fi.sv
# and classifies each run:
#
#   detected        a safety mechanism latched a fault
#   detected-sw     the workload itself spotted the fault and exited
#                   with its own code.  Distinct from `detected`
#                   because no safety mechanism latched anything: when
#                   the fault is the safety controller's own enable,
#                   software is the only thing left that can report.
#   silent-ok       no fault, the result was correct, and the safety
#                   configuration was left intact
#   latent          no fault, the result was correct, and yet the
#                   configuration is NOT what it should be -- an upset
#                   has switched a detector off and nothing noticed.
#                   Classified apart from silent-ok because calling it
#                   benign is exactly wrong: the workload passing is not
#                   evidence when the thing that would have complained
#                   is the thing that was hit.
#   SDC             no fault, and the result was WRONG -- silent data
#                   corruption, the number that matters most
#   hang            the workload never finished
#   sim-timeout     the simulator itself was killed for overrunning,
#                   which is a bench problem rather than a result
#   not-injected    the deposit never happened, because the injection
#                   cycle fell past the end of the workload.  Counted
#                   separately and excluded from the percentages: it is
#                   a hole in the campaign setup, not a result.
#
# The fault list is a named set of state elements, not every flop in the
# design; the report says so, because a diagnostic coverage figure means
# nothing without the fault list it was measured over.
