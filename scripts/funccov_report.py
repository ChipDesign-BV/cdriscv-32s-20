# Functional coverage report (objective O7).
#
# Reads a merged Verilator coverage database and summarises the `user`
# points -- the cover statements in verif/cover/cdriscv_32s_20_cover.sv.  Line
# and toggle points are ignored here; they have their own report, and
# mixing the three into one number is exactly the mistake recorded as
# V7-M1.
#
# Points are summed across scopes, because the question a cover point
# asks is "was this situation ever reached", not "was it reached
# everywhere".  A scope is one hierarchical path, and there are two
# reasons the same point appears in several:
#
#   * the block really is instantiated more than once -- the two
#     lockstep cores, for instance; and
#   * the same block appears under each testbench root, so a point hit
#     in tb_cdriscv_subsys and not in tb_cosim reads as "1 of 2".
#
# The count is reported as scopes rather than instances for that
# reason: it is not a per-instance figure and should not be read as
# one.  Note also that Verilator merges identically named sibling
# instances into a wildcard scope -- the two TCMs arrive as `u_*tcm` --
# so the I-TCM and D-TCM cannot be told apart here.  Where that
# distinction matters it is covered from the safety controller side
# instead, which has a separate fault bit for each.
