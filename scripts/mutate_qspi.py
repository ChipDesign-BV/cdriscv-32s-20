"""Mutation-validate the QSPI boot loader benches (`block-qspi`, `make bootsim`).

    python3 scripts/mutate_qspi.py       # from the repository root

Each mutant is a single, plausible design error in the loader
(rtl/boot/cdriscv_32s_20_qspi_boot.sv).  For each mutant the targets are
run cheapest first -- block-qspi, then bootsim -- and the mutant is
killed by the FIRST one that fails.  A mutant that survives both is a
hole in the benches, not a pass.  The originals are restored
unconditionally in a finally block.

What each mutant proves the benches can see:

* crc-ignored: the CRC verdict term is deleted from fail_w, so a
  corrupt payload boots.  Scenario 4 (corrupt CRC must fault, never
  release) is the check that owns this.
* magic-ignored: any flash content is accepted as a header.  Scenario 5
  requires a bad magic to fault with ZERO bus writes.
* bounds-dropped: the per-segment TCM range check is forced true, so a
  wild segment would be written.  Scenarios 6/7 require a fault with
  ZERO bus writes.
* retry-cap-dropped: the retry counter comparison is forced false, so
  a persistent failure retries for ever instead of latching boot_fault.
  Scenario 4's fault/verdict checks and its exact CS-session count see
  it.
* release-before-verdict: boot_done is asserted when the payload
  transfer ends, BEFORE the CRC compare.  Scenario 4 requires that a
  corrupt image never releases (done_rises must stay 0).
* quad-ignores-flag: the payload command no longer follows FLAGS[0].
  Scenario 2 checks the flash saw EBh exactly when the flag said so.
* fault-not-sticky: S_FAULT clears boot_fault after one cycle.
  Scenario 4 re-reads boot_fault 1000 cycles after the verdict.
* timeout-dropped: the progress watchdog can never fire, so a bus that
  stops granting hangs the loader for ever.  Scenario 8 (gnt withheld)
  requires a bounded fault, and its wait is finite.

The same warning as scripts/mutate_zcmp.py: a surviving mutant is a
claim about the bench, so first be sure the mutant is a real change.
