# Makes a yosys netlist readable by OpenSTA's structural Verilog parser.
#
# The memories are black boxes, and yosys writes them with their
# parameter overrides:
#
#     cdriscv_32s_20_tcm #(.Depth(32'd4096), .InitFile("")) u_dtcm (...)
#
# OpenSTA has no module and no liberty cell for cdriscv_32s_20_tcm, and its
# parser rejects the parameter list outright.  The parameters carry no
# timing information -- they set the array depth and a simulation
# preload file -- so removing them for the timing netlist loses nothing.
#
# The memories remain untimed either way.  Paths that start or end
# inside them are not analysed, which is correct for a black box and is
# stated in the report rather than left for the reader to notice.
