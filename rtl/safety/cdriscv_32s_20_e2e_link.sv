// cdriscv-32s-20 -- E2E protection endpoints for one bus link.
//
// cdriscv_32s_20_e2e.sv provides the generator/checker pair (7 check
// bits over {data, addr}, both run through the proven (39,32) Hsiao
// matrix).  This file wraps that pair into the two ENDPOINTS a
// protected master<->slave link needs, so the interconnect itself stays
// free of E2E logic and its muxing stays readable:
//
//   _m  master side: generates the write-path check bits over
//       {wdata, addr} as the core presents them, holds the granted
//       address until the response returns, and checks every read
//       response from a protected slave against the check bits that
//       slave generated.
//   _s  slave side: checks every delivered write against the check
//       bits carried from the master -- a mismatch here means the
//       interconnect corrupted the payload or the address on the way
//       -- and generates the read-path check bits over {rdata, held
//       address of the outstanding access}.
//
// What this covers, and what it does not:
//
//   * A request or response corrupted between master and slave port --
//     data or address -- is flagged at the receiving end.  Wrong-ADDRESS
//     delivery with intact data is the case the TCM-internal ECC cannot
//     see, and is exactly what the address fold catches: the slave's
//     held address no longer matches the master's, so the read-path
//     check bits disagree.
//   * The access-type bit is cross-checked: a read that the slave
//     performed as a write (or vice versa) flags, because the slave
//     only generates read check bits for what it saw as a read.
//   * Byte enables are NOT covered: the e2e module's fold is fixed at
//     {data, addr} and is not modified here.  A be corruption in
//     flight changes which bytes a sub-word write commits; that gap is
//     documented in doc/variant_status.md.
//   * Sub-word writes ARE covered on the write path: the check is made
//     on the delivered request wires, before the TCM's internal
//     read-modify-write, and the full 32-bit wdata bus is compared as
//     presented.  Nothing here compares against what the TCM stores,
//     so the RMW merge cannot false-flag.
//
// A write-path mismatch does not kill the write -- gating the request
// would change bus timing -- it completes and the fault latches in the
// safety controller (FLT_E2E), which is where a detected-but-uncontained
// fault belongs.
//
// STATUS: block-verified (verif/block/e2e_link, mutation tested) and
// instantiated by the subsystem on the two TCM links.  NOT qualified
// for safety-critical use.
