// cdriscv-32s-20 -- instruction fetch stage.
//
// Sequential prefetcher with a two-entry instruction buffer and a
// single outstanding bus transaction.  A redirect (branch, jump, trap,
// MRET, FENCE.I) empties the buffer and marks an in-flight response to
// be dropped, so no stale instruction can ever reach the execute stage.
//
// Why two entries and a same-cycle re-request (finding V2-P1).  The
// first version buffered one instruction and only issued the next fetch
// when that buffer was being emptied.  With a one cycle memory that
// costs a bubble on every instruction -- request at T, data at T+1,
// execute at T+2 -- so CPI could not go below 2 whatever the program
// did.  Two things fix it:
//
//   * a request may be issued in the same cycle as the response to the
//     previous one arrives, which is the ordinary OBI pipelining of an
//     address phase against a response phase.  There is still never
//     more than one transaction in flight, which is what the bus's
//     one-owner-bit-per-slave routing requires.
//   * the buffer holds two instructions, so a response always has
//     somewhere to land.  With one entry the fetcher could not issue
//     ahead safely: if the execute stage stalled on a multi-cycle
//     instruction, the arriving word would overwrite the one waiting.
//
// Bus rule: instr_rvalid_i must not be asserted in the same cycle as
// instr_gnt_i *for the same transaction* (standard OBI response phase,
// one cycle or more after its address phase).  A grant for the next
// transaction in the same cycle as a response for the previous one is
// allowed and is what makes back-to-back fetching work.
//
// STATUS: inherited unchanged from cdriscv-32s-10, where it met that
// repository's O1-O7 gate.  That gate does NOT carry over -- see
// README.md.  NOT qualified for safety-critical use.
