// Formal properties for cdriscv_32s_20_if_stage.
//
// The fetch stage is the riskiest block in the design: three concurrent
// state updates -- request accepted, response accepted, redirect --
// share one always block, and the interesting cases are the ones where
// they coincide.  Simulation can only sample that space; bounded model
// checking covers it.
//
// The central property is simple to state and hard to satisfy by
// accident: **the stage delivers exactly the sequential instruction
// stream that starts at the most recent redirect target**.  A stale
// instruction surviving a redirect, a discarded response surfacing, or
// a PC that skips or repeats all violate it.
//
// The RTL is not modified: this wrapper instantiates it and carries the
// properties, together with the bus protocol assumptions the stage is
// entitled to rely on.

  // 1. instr_rdata_i is tied off.  No property here reads the
  //    instruction word -- they are all about which address is fetched
  //    and which PC is delivered -- so leaving 32 bits free per step
  //    only costs solver time.
  //
  // 2. redirect targets are confined to the low 1 KiB.  The PC
  //    datapath is uniform in width, so any bug in the *control* --
  //    a stale instruction surviving a redirect, a discarded response
  //    surfacing, two transactions in flight -- still has a
  //    counterexample inside that range.  What this would miss is a
  //    bug that only appears at a particular high address, a carry
  //    chain error for instance.  That class is left to simulation.

  // 3. The PMP verdict is one symbolic denied word, constant through
  //    the trace.  A per-cycle-free fetch_allow_i was tried first and
  //    is sound but intractable: the routine ten-second BMC became
  //    minutes per step from step 17 on (measured before it was
  //    stopped).  Between configuration writes the real verdict is a
  //    pure function of the fetch address, so a solver-chosen NA4-like
  //    denied word models it faithfully: the denied word is re-met
  //    across redirects, which exercises injection coinciding with a
  //    fill, with a redirect, and with back-pressure.  What this
  //    abstraction misses is a pmpcfg/pmpaddr REWRITE while fetches
  //    are in flight; `make pmp` covers that in simulation (its
  //    check 22 exists precisely because of it).
