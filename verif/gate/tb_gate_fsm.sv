// Illegal state recovery, on the gate level netlist.
//
// Coverage waiver W2a keeps the `default:` arms of the state machines
// on the grounds that they are unreachable in simulation but are what
// returns the machine to a defined state after an upset.  That argument
// is made against the RTL, and the waiver itself says it has to be
// re-made against the netlist, because synthesis is entitled to notice
// that a state is unreachable and optimise the recovery away.
//
// This is that check.  The multiplier's three states are encoded in two
// flip-flops, so exactly one encoding is unused.  The netlist is forced
// into each of the four encodings in turn and clocked once; every one
// of them must lead to a defined state, and the unused one must lead
// back to idle rather than to X or to a lock-up.
//
// If synthesis had dropped the recovery, the unused encoding would
// either hold or produce X here, and W2a would be false at gate level.
