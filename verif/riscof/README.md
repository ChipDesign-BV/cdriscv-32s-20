# RISCOF — architectural test suite (objective O1)

**Status: infrastructure in place, not yet producing a result.** Read
the last section before quoting anything from here.

## What this is

RISCOF runs the official `riscv-arch-test` suite against the DUT and a
reference model, and compares signatures. It is the only thing that
answers "does this core implement the RISC-V specification" — Spike
co-simulation answers the weaker question "does it agree with Spike on
the programs we happened to write".

## Setup

The test suite is 1.7 GB and is not vendored:

```sh
pip install "cython<3" && pip install --no-build-isolation riscof
cd verif/riscof && riscof arch-test --clone
```

The plugins expect a `riscv32-unknown-elf-*` toolchain prefix and this
environment ships `riscv64-`, which targets rv32 perfectly well through
`-march`/`-mabi`. Symlink rather than patch the vendor plugin:

```sh
for t in gcc objcopy nm objdump ld as; do
  ln -sf "$(command -v riscv64-unknown-elf-$t)" ~/.local/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-$t
done
```

Then `make riscof`.

## How the DUT plugin works

`cdriscv/riscof_cdriscv.py` builds each test and runs it on the Icarus
co-simulation bench:

1. `objcopy` the ELF to a flat binary from `0x8000_0000`, padded to
   `end_signature`, so code, `.tohost` and the signature region land at
   the right word offsets;
2. `mkimage.py` turns that into the 39-bit ECC hex image the TCM loads
   — the same builder the rest of the suite uses;
3. `vvp` runs it with `+TOHOST`, `+SIGBEGIN`, `+SIGEND` and `+SIGFILE`.

The bench watches for the store to `tohost`, then dumps the signature
words straight out of the I-TCM array. The SEC-DED encoding is
systematic — `cw = {parity, data}` — so the data half is the low 32
bits. All four plusargs come from the ELF symbol table via `nm`;
nothing about the addresses is assumed.

`env/model_test.h` and `env/link.ld` are the target environment. There
is no console, so the IO macros are empty and the signature is the only
output.

## Status: 85 of 85 pass, on the current suite

`make riscof` runs against the **current `riscv-arch-test`, unmodified**:
39 from I, 8 from M, 22 hints, 15 privilege, 1 Zifencei. **85 passed, 0
failed.**

Two things make that work, both in `cdriscv/riscof_cdriscv.py` and
`spike/riscof_spike.py`:

* **`-mno-relax`.** The suite's `LA` macro brackets its alignment in
  `.option rvc`, so the assembler pads with `c.nop` even on a target with no
  C extension, and linker relaxation keeps that padding in the executed
  stream. An RV32I core must trap on a 16-bit encoding, and Spike traps at
  the same address. Turning relaxation off resolves the padding away. This
  replaces the earlier workaround of pinning the suite to release 3.5.3.
* **The `pmp` group is dropped from the generated test list.** All 43 gate
  PMP on `verify (PMP['implemented'])`, and RISCOF selects on `check` clauses
  only, so they are selected on any RV32 I+Zicsr core. This core implements
  no PMP and has no U mode. `make riscof` prints how many it dropped.

Both, and two more, are written up in [upstream-issues.md](upstream-issues.md).

### Setup

```sh
pip install "cython<3" && pip install --no-build-isolation riscof
cd verif/riscof && riscof arch-test --clone
git -C riscv-arch-test checkout old-framework-3.x   # main no longer has the suite
for t in gcc objcopy nm objdump ld as; do
  ln -sf "$(command -v riscv64-unknown-elf-$t)" ~/.local/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf-$t
done
```

### One trap to be careful of

`RVMODEL_DATA_SECTION` must expand inside `RVMODEL_DATA_END`, after
`end_signature` — never inside `RVMODEL_DATA_BEGIN`. On RISC-V `.align 8`
means 256 bytes, so that block drags ~400 bytes of padding with it, and ahead
of the signature the padding sits between `rvtest_data` and `mtrap_sigptr`.
The arch-test trap handler records `mtval` *relative to `mtrap_sigptr`*, so
the same faulting address then encodes as a different number than in the
reference build, and every misaligned-**load** test fails while everything
else passes. See finding V35.

## History

The suite was first unrunnable (the `LA` macro's `c.nop` padding traps
any non-C core — `-mno-relax` resolves it), then pinned to release
3.5.3, then unpinned. The whole trail, including the three misaligned-
load failures that turned out to be this repository's own environment
defect, is findings V34–V36 and [upstream-issues.md](upstream-issues.md).
