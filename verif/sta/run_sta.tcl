# OpenSTA run for the synthesised subsystem.
#
# PRE-LAYOUT, AND PRE-BUFFERING.  There is no placement, no extracted
# parasitics, and no buffer tree on any high fanout net.  Read the
# setup numbers below with that in mind: they are dominated by the
# reset distribution, which a single flip-flop currently drives into
# a couple of thousand reset pins.  Building that tree is a
# place-and-route job, exactly as clock tree synthesis is, and no
# amount of RTL change makes it unnecessary.
#
# What this run is good for: proving hold is met, showing the fanout
# that has to be fixed, and confirming the logic depth is not the
# problem.  What it cannot give is an Fmax.
