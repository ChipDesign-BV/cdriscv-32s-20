# Timing constraints for cdriscv_32s_20_subsys.
#
# Two clocks, and they are genuinely asynchronous.  The clock monitor
# exists precisely because the reference oscillator is independent of
# the system clock, and every signal that crosses between them goes
# through the synchronisers in cdriscv_32s_20_sync.sv.  Declaring them
# asynchronous is therefore correct rather than a convenience: analysing
# those paths as if they were related would produce violations that mean
# nothing and hide the ones that do.

# 40 ns = 25 MHz.  The target was 100 MHz, reduced to 50 MHz on
# 2026-08-24, and reduced again to 25 MHz on 2026-08-26 when the first
# full RTL2GDS run showed the design missing 20 ns by 9 ns at the SLOW
# corner (1.08 V, 125 C).  The earlier "closed at 50 MHz" claim came
# from a typical-corner-only analysis -- see finding V45.
