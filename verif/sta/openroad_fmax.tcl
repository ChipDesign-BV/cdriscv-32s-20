# cdriscv_32s_20_subsys -- placed-and-buffered timing estimate (V38).
#
# The plain `make sta` number comes from an unbuffered netlist straight
# out of abc: every net ideal, every fanout free.  That is not an Fmax,
# it is a lower bound on optimism.  This flow floorplans the subsystem
# with its four real SRAM banks, places it, lets the resizer insert
# buffers and resize gates against placement-estimated parasitics, and
# only then asks for slack.  No CTS and no routing: the clock is still
# ideal, held honest by the uncertainty margin below.  The result is a
# pre-layout estimate, stated as such -- but one on a netlist that has
# paid for its wire loads and its fanout.

# THREE corners, not one.  Reading only the typical library is what
# made this script report "closed at 50 MHz" for a design that missed
# its constraint by 9 ns at the slow corner (finding V45).  The slow
# corner is the binding one for setup; keep it first so a careless
# reading of the output sees it first.
